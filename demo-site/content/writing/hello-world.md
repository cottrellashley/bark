# Hello World

Welcome to your first Bark post!

## Writing Content

Posts are just markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Put them in a collection directory and Bark
will take care of the rest.

### Code highlighting

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello from Bark!")
```

### Lists

- Write in markdown
- Configure with YAML
- Build with `bark build`
- Serve with `bark serve`

Happy writing!
